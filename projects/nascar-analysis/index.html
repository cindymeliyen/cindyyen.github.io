I&#x27;ve been blessed to be able to work on some projects in the past and I continue to occasionally post NASCAR TV viewership analysis on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cindymeliyen">Twitter</a> for almost 2,000 fans and industry members.</p><p>The following is some of my greatest hits analyses and research. Please note that some of these projects are a few years old but I&#x27;m still proud of them.</p><section><h3>Data Analysis</h3><p><li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/cindymeliyen/status/1729547465378914597">Analysis of Chase Elliott Effect</a></b> - Chase Elliott is NASCAR&#x27;s most popular driver. How was viewership affected when he was out with an injury for a few weeks? </li><li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/cindymeliyen/status/1927885077238706299">NASCAR on Prime First Race Analysis</a></b> - NASCAR had their first race exclusively on streaming for one of their biggest races of the year, the World 600. This analysis explores how it performed. </li><li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cindymeliyen/">NASCAR Viewership Tableau Dashboards</a></b> - I use Tableau dashboards regularly in my day job but this is a link to some dashboards that I&#x27;ve made as examples. One shows off Tableau features and the other is a more practical dashboard that shows the graphs I regularly screenshot for my Twitter analysis. </li></p></section><section><h3>Research Reports</h3><p><li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://nascarthesis.wordpress.com/">NASCAR Perceptions</a></b> - This was my senior thesis for undergrad, in which I explored perceptions of NASCAR and how they affect fandom. </li><li><b><a href="/files/NASCAR_commercial_breaks.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Do NASCAR Fans Do During Commercial Breaks?</a></b> - I asked NASCAR fans what they do during commercial breaks because I had a hypothesis that average viewership is lower than it could be because people change the channel during ad breaks, and that ads would be more effective side-by-side with live racing action because people don&#x27;t pay attention during full-screen ads. Funny enough broadcasters are now pushing more for side-by-side ad breaks during green flag racing. </li></p></section><br/></article></main><footer><div class="footer"><p style="color:Black">Connect With Me On <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/cindy-yen">LinkedIn</a> | Shoot Me An <a href="mailto:cindymeliyen@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a></p><br/>Made by Cindy Yen, Spencer Lanman, and a little help from AI.</div></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/projects/nascar-analysis","query":{},"buildId":"HNlW9IL84AfuvSroLIDhV","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
